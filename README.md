## Case Study on Life Expectancy
Tasks below are carried out in this case study.
1. Choose one independent variable by doing EDA to fit a simple linear regression model.
2. Choose other independent variables to fit another TWO (2) multiple linear regression models. The independent 
3. Compare the three models above and conclude which of them is the best.
4. Perform a prediction using the best model above to find the 95% confidence interval of life expectancy using a set of reasonable X values.
